# Backlinks Strategy for RetireFree

## Why Backlinks Matter

Backlinks = other websites linking to yours. Google sees this as "votes of confidence."

**Impact on SEO:**
- Domain Authority increases (helps you rank higher)
- Direct referral traffic from those sites
- Faster indexing by Google
- Better rankings for competitive keywords

**Goal:** Get 10-20 quality backlinks in first 3 months

## Strategy #1: Resource Page Outreach

### Target Sites:
Financial websites with "resources" or "tools" pages

**Examples:**
- Bogleheads.org (retirement community)
- Early-retirement.org
- r/financialindependence wiki
- Personal finance blogs with resource pages

### How to Find Them:
Google searches:
- "retirement planning resources"
- "best retirement calculators"
- "financial independence tools"
- "retirement planning inurl:resources"

### Outreach Email Template:

```
Subject: Retirement calculator for your resources page

Hi [Name],

I'm a fan of [Website] - your guide on [specific topic] helped me when I retired 2 years ago.

I noticed your resources page lists retirement calculators. I recently built one that might fit: RetireFree.app

What makes it different:
- Uses 2026 market data (not outdated 4% rule)
- Adjusts monthly based on portfolio performance
- Free calculator, no signup required

Here's the link if you think it's worth adding: https://retirefree.app

Either way, keep up the great work!

Best,
[Your Name]

## Strategy #4: Content Partnerships

### Partnership Pitch:

```
Hi [Name],

I run RetireFree.app - a retirement withdrawal calculator for early retirees.

I noticed we serve similar audiences (retirees planning their finances). Would you be open to:

1. **Content collaboration**: I write a guest post for your blog, you link to my calculator
2. **Resource exchange**: We list each other on our "resources" pages
3. **Affiliate partnership**: You refer clients, I give you 20% recurring commission

No pressure - just thought there might be synergy!

## Strategy #5: HARO (Help a Reporter Out)

Journalists looking for expert sources. You provide quotes, they link to your site.

**Sign up:** helpareporter.com

### How It Works:
1. Subscribe to HARO emails (3x per day)
2. Look for queries about retirement, finance, FIRE
3. Respond quickly with expert quote
4. Get featured in articles (with backlink)

### Example Query:
"Looking for retirement planning experts to comment on safe withdrawal rates"

### Your Response:
```
Hi [Journalist Name],

I'm [Your Name], creator of RetireFree.app and early retiree.

Here's my take on safe withdrawal rates in 2026:

"The classic 4% rule is outdated. Current research from Morningstar and Vanguard suggests 3.3-3.8% is safer given 2026's high market valuations. The key is flexibility - retirees who can adjust spending during downturns have much higher success rates."

[Include 2-3 more expert quotes]

Bio: [Your Name] is the creator of RetireFree.app, a retirement withdrawal calculator used by [X] retirees. Website: https://retirefree.app

Available for follow-up questions!

Best,
[Your Name]

   - Can link to resources in context
