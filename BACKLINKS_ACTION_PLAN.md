The 4% rule is outdated for 2026. Current research (Morningstar, Vanguard)
suggests 3.3-3.8% is safer given today's valuations.

I built a calculator that factors in current conditions:

It's free to try, no signup required.

### 3. Where55.com Reciprocal Link (15 mins)

Add RetireFree link to Where55.com:

This creates a **link network** between sister sites (good for SEO).

Hi [Name],

I came across your resources page at [URL] and noticed you list
retirement planning tools.

Key features:
- Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 scenarios
- Free calculator, no signup required
- $15/month for ongoing updates (vs $5K/year advisors)

Here's the link if you think it's worth adding:
https://retirefree.app/calculator

Either way, keep up the great work!

Best,
[Your Name]

Hi [Name],

[specific article] was excellent.

I recently researched safe withdrawal rates for 2026 and found
some surprising data from Morningstar and Vanguard.

Would you be interested in a guest post?

Proposed title: "The 4% Rule is Dead: What Safe Withdrawal Rates
Actually Work in 2026"
