## 4. First Comment (Founder's Story)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Huajie, and I built RetireFree to solve a problem that affects millions of retirees.

**The Problem:**
My parents retired two years ago with a decent nest egg, but they were paralyzed by one question: "How much can we safely spend each month?" The 4% rule seemed too simple. Financial advisors wanted $5,000+ per year. Online calculators gave conflicting advice. They ended up spending too little out of fear—missing out on experiences they'd worked their whole lives to enjoy.

**The Solution:**
I realized that with modern AI, we could democratize sophisticated financial planning. RetireFree uses AI to analyze your unique situation—age, savings, expenses, risk tolerance—and calculates your optimal withdrawal strategy. It's like having a financial advisor in your pocket, but for $15/month instead of $5,000/year.

**Why I Built This:**
- **Personal mission:** Help retirees like my parents retire free from financial worry
- **Market need:** 60% of retirees are off-track with their spending plans
- **Technology opportunity:** DeepSeek AI made this affordable to build and operate
- **Bootstrap challenge:** Entire MVP built for $200—proving you don't need VC funding to solve real problems

**What Makes RetireFree Different:**
- **Simple focus:** We do ONE thing really well—tell you how much to withdraw
- **AI-powered:** Adapts to market changes and your personal situation
- **Affordable:** 99% cheaper than traditional advisors
- **Transparent:** No hidden fees, clear methodology, cancel anytime

**What's Next:**
- Week 1-2: Gather feedback and iterate on UX
- Week 3-4: Add scenario planning ("What if I take a $5K vacation?")
- Month 2-3: Mobile apps (iOS + Android)
- Month 4+: Portfolio sync with major brokerages

**What I Need from You:**
- Try the free calculator and tell me what you think
- If you know someone nearing retirement, please share this with them
- Honest feedback—what's working, what's confusing, what's missing?

**Special ProductHunt Offer:**
First 100 subscribers get 30-day trial (instead of 7 days) + lifetime 20% discount ($12/month forever). Use code: **HUNTER20**

Thanks for checking out RetireFree! I'm here all day to answer questions and take feedback. Let's help retirees retire free from worry. 🚀

## 7. Pre-Written Responses to Common Questions

### "How is this different from [competitor]?"
"Great question! Unlike comprehensive planning tools (NewRetirement, Boldin), RetireFree focuses on ONE job: telling you how much to withdraw each month. We're simpler, more affordable ($15 vs. $120+/year), and our AI adapts to changing conditions automatically. Think of us as the specialized tool you check monthly, not the overwhelming spreadsheet you set up once and never update."

### "Can I trust AI with my retirement?"
"I totally understand the skepticism. Here's how we handle it: (1) Our AI uses conservative, time-tested withdrawal strategies as a foundation, then adapts based on your situation. (2) We show our reasoning so you can see WHY we recommend a certain amount. (3) You're always in control—treat our recommendations as guidance, not gospel. (4) We're transparent about our methodology and never promise unrealistic returns."

### "Why not just use the 4% rule?"
"The 4% rule was great when it was created (1994), but it has major flaws: (1) It doesn't adapt to market conditions, (2) It ignores your personal situation, (3) Research shows it's too conservative for some retirees and too aggressive for others. RetireFree uses a dynamic approach that adjusts monthly based on actual conditions—helping you spend more when it's safe and pull back when needed."

### "What if markets crash?"
"This is exactly what RetireFree is designed for. When markets drop, our AI recalculates your safe withdrawal amount and gives you a clear recommendation. You'll know immediately if you need to adjust spending temporarily. This beats the alternative: panicking and making emotional decisions, or blindly following the 4% rule and potentially running out of money."

### "Is my data secure?"
"Yes. We use bank-level encryption (256-bit) for all data. Your information is encrypted in transit and at rest. We never sell your data to third parties. You can disconnect your accounts anytime. We're GDPR compliant and follow industry best practices. For MVP, we actually don't even connect to your real accounts—you input values manually, giving you full control."

### "Do I need to be tech-savvy?"
"Not at all. If you can use email, you can use RetireFree. The calculator is 5 simple questions. The dashboard shows one main number: 'Safe to withdraw $X this month.' No spreadsheets, no jargon, no complex charts (unless you want to see them)."

### "Can I cancel anytime?"
"Absolutely. No contracts, no commitments. Cancel with one click via your account settings. You'll keep access through the end of your billing period. We'd rather have happy customers who stay because they want to, not because they're locked in."

### "What's your business model long-term?"
"Subscriptions ($15/month) are our core revenue. Eventually we'll add: (1) Premium tier ($49/month) with CFP consultations and advanced tax planning, (2) Financial advisor partnerships (white-label our tech), (3) Educational content/courses. But we'll always keep the base tier affordable—that's our mission."

### Reddit r/SideProject Post
[Title] I built an AI retirement advisor for $200 (Product Hunt launch today)

[Body]
Hey r/SideProject!

Just launched RetireFree on Product Hunt—an AI-powered retirement withdrawal calculator built on a $200 bootstrap budget.

**The Problem:**
My parents retired with $700K saved but were paralyzed by one question: "How much can we safely spend?" The 4% rule seemed too simple. Financial advisors wanted $5,000+/year. They ended up spending too little out of fear.

**The Solution:**
RetireFree uses AI (DeepSeek) to calculate optimal withdrawal strategies for $15/month. Think: financial advisor in your pocket, 99% cheaper.

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)
- AI: DeepSeek API
- Payments: Stripe
- Hosting: Vercel

**Budget Breakdown:**
- Domain (retirefree.app): $15/year
- Everything else: FREE tier
- DeepSeek API: ~$2-5/month for first 100 users
- Total Month 1: ~$17

**Launch Stats (12 hours in):**
- [X] upvotes on Product Hunt
- [X] trial signups
- [X] paying customers already

**What I Learned:**
1. DeepSeek is legit—85% cheaper than OpenAI, great quality
2. You don't need VC funding to solve real problems
3. Focusing on ONE job (withdrawal strategy) beats trying to be everything
4. Bootstrap forces you to prioritize ruthlessly

Would love your feedback: https://retirefree.app
