## Problem Statement

### Headline
You've Saved for Decades. Now What?

### Body Copy
Retirement should be the best years of your life. But for most retirees, spending decisions feel like walking a tightrope.

Spend too much, and you risk running out of money. Spend too little, and you miss out on the life you worked so hard for.

You're not alone. 60% of retirees are off-track with their spending. 58% worry constantly about running out of money. And 81% lose sleep over unexpected healthcare costs.

The problem isn't your savings. It's knowing how much you can safely spend today while protecting your future.

Traditional advice is too simple. "Withdraw 4% per year" doesn't account for market changes, inflation, or your unique situation. And hiring a financial advisor costs $5,000 or more each year.

There has to be a better way.
